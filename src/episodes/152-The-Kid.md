A woman decides to abandon her baby in the backseat of an automobile with a handwritten note attached, beseeching the finder to care for and love the child. The baby is discovered by the initially-reluctant Tramp, who eventually softens and comes to love him as his own. As the boy grows up, both he and The Tramp must learn to navigate through a life that spawns one adventure after another.
