Drifting from town to town, the poncho-clad Man with No Name and the lightning-fast right hand rides into the town of El Paso in search of maniacal escaped convict El Indio. It's been 18 short months since the deadly confrontation in A Fistful of Dollars (1964), and this time, the solitary stranger, now a professional bounty hunter, must go against his beliefs and do the unthinkable: join forces with hawk-eyed marksman Colonel Douglas Mortimer to collect the hefty reward. Now, as El Indio and his cut-throats have already set their sights on robbing the crammed-with-cash Bank of El Paso, the stage is set for a bloody showdown at high noon, against the backdrop of silent double-crosses and fragile allegiances. But, is it worth dicing with death for a few dollars more?
