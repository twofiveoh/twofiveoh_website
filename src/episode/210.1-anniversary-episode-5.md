Oh my god, it's that time of year already! Douglas and Jonathan look back over the penultimate 365 day slice of the TwoFiveOh, both reminiscing and looking to the future! Which movie did they hate the most? Which movies did Jonathan forget existed? Will the cool generic Christmas jazz we play underneath the entire episode get us a copyright strike?
