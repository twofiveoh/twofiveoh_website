It's been four whole ding-dang years of the TwoFiveOh and we are in for our most star-studded year yet with the penultimate year of the podcast which actually makes me a bit sad typing out. Join Douglas and Jonathan as they reflect back on the year that was 2023 as they desperately try to avoid picking bonus films that they did throughout the year for their best/worst films on this week's episode of the 2023 Anniversary Review Episode.
