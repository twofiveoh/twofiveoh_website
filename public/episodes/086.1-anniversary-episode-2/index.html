The boys spent the days prior to the New Year reflecting on the year of cinema that they watched and look forward toward the year to come!A massive thank you to all of our listeners that have joined us on the journey so far and we hope to see you for the many more years of the podcast to come! Wishing you all the health and happiness for 2022.</p>
