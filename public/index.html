Over rocks, through towns, across rivers, the group is always just behind them. When they finally escape through sheer luck, Butch has another idea, &quot;Let's go to Bolivia&quot;. Based on the exploits of the historical characters.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/009-Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/2spUdTu8S7nR0BObWLqYZ4" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzOTE2NjkxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgzMTg0MzE@._V1_SY300_CR1,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">241</span><br><span class="title">PK</span><br><span class="date">2014</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.1 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2338151"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>P. K. is a comedy of ideas about a stranger in the city, who asks questions that no one has asked before. They are innocent, child-like questions, but they bring about catastrophic answers. People who are set in their ways for generations, are forced to reappraise their world when they see it from PK's innocent eyes. In the process PK makes loyal friends and powerful foes. Mends broken lives and angers the establishment. P. K.'s childlike curiosity transforms into a spiritual odyssey for him and millions of others. The film is an ambitious and uniquely original exploration of complex philosophies. It is also a simple and humane tale of love, laughter and letting-go. Finally, it is a moving saga about a friendship between strangers.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/010-PK" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/3yXemCqC4yfNS17zNWlvtC" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxMDc1NjcyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU0NDYxMzI@._V1_SY300_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">b2</span><br><span class="title">The Death of Stalin</span><br><span class="date">2018</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 7.2 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4686844"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>In early-1953 Moscow, under the Great Terror's heavy cloak of state paranoia, the ever-watchful Soviet leader, Iosif Stalin, collapses unexpectedly of a brain haemorrhage.

Aibileen (Davis), Skeeter's best friend's housekeeper, is the first to open up -- to the dismay of her friends in the tight-knit black community. Despite Skeeter's life-long friendships hanging in the balance, she and Aibileen continue their collaboration and soon more women come forward to tell their stories -- and as it turns out, they have a lot to say.

Although he is vague to reporters about the source material for the book, it is about his chance encounter nine years earlier on June 15-16, 1994 with a Parisienne named Celine, and the memorable and romantic day and evening they spent together in Vienna. At the end of their encounter at the Vienna train station, which is also how the book ends, they, not providing contact information to the other, vowed to meet each other again in exactly six months at that very spot. As the media scrum at the bookstore nears its conclusion, Jesse spots Celine in the crowd, she who only found out about the book when she earlier saw his photograph promoting this public appearance. Much like their previous encounter, Jesse and Celine, who is now an environmental activist, decide to spend time together until he is supposed to catch his flight back to New York, this time only being about an hour. Beyond the issue of the six month meeting, what has happened in their lives in the intervening nine years, and their current lives, they once again talk about their philosophies of life and love, this time with the knowledge of their day together and how it shaped what has happened to them.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/013-Before-Sunset" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/4bFvYOEnuTcApaYKZtRASw" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdiOTVjZmQtNjAyNy00YjA2LTk5ZTAtNmJkMGQ5N2RmNjUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_SY300_CR1,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">237</span><br><span class="title">The Princess Bride</span><br><span class="date">1987</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.0 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>An elderly man reads the book &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; to his sick and thus currently bedridden adolescent grandson, the reading of the book which has been passed down within the family for generations. The grandson is sure he won't like the story, with a romance at its core, he prefers something with lots of action and &quot;no kissing&quot;, but he lets grandfather continue, because he doesn't want to hurt his feelings. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of &quot;as you wish&quot; to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/014-The-Princess-Bride" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/5o1v4740TYEDWdgyZtIrjh" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5NjY4MjUwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM3NzM5MzE@._V1_SY300_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">236</span><br><span class="title">Gangs of Wasseypur</span><br><span class="date">2012</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.2 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1954470"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>Shahid Khan is exiled after impersonating the legendary Sultana Daku in order to rob British trains.

Despite the Belgians having placed the Tutsis in a higher position during the Belgian rule, they have placed the majority Hutus in power after independence. Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu married to a Tutsi, Tatiana Rusesabagina, is the House Manager of the Hotel Des Milles Collines in Kigali. The Milles Collines, owned by Sabena (the national airline of Belgium), is a four-star hotel catering primarily to wealthy white westerners. Paul, who knows how to work the system to run the hotel effectively for its guests and for Sabena, is proud that most of the Caucasians who he meets in this professional capacity treat him with respect. After a specific incident, the relative calm between the Tutsi guerrillas and government-backed Hutu militia takes a turn. Paul's thought that the native population as a whole who are not directly involved in the conflict will be protected as the UN peacekeeping forces and thus the world is watching doesn't happen as the western world largely evacuates from Rwanda and abandons the natives. Such begins what will become a genocide of the Tutsi population. Paul, who is able to get his immediate family to the hotel which is still largely seen as a place of sanctuary, will have to use the considerable skills he has used to run the hotel as well as he has instead to keep himself, his family and any others taking refuge at the hotel alive, whether they be Hutu or Tutsi. Meanwhile, Colonel Oliver, a Canadian heading the UN peacekeeping forces, and Pat Archer with the Red Cross do what they can to assist Paul and to get people to safety first to the hotel then out of the country, while field journalists, like photographer Jack Daglish, try to bring the genocide back into the global media to have the world once again care about what is going on.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/030-Hotel-Rwanda" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/5193BSURIQmrevx5qAvMRH" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI5ODc4MTAtN2U2NC00ZDk3LWE3NjAtNjIyODE2YTlhYjYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTA3ODI3NDA@._V1_SY300_CR3,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">b6</span><br><span class="title">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</span><br><span class="date">2010</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 7.5 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>Scott Pilgrim plays in a band which aspires to success.

He also admits that he is not a model citizen, having committed a petty robbery while in London. He does however profess his innocence when it comes to the bombing of the Guildford Pub in London in 1974, the event which killed several people inside. A self-professed non-political person, he and his three co-accused, dubbed the Guildford Four, are thought to be provisional members of the I.R.A. Their self-professed innocence is despite each having signed a statement of guilt which they claim were signed under duress. Their case includes having provable alibis for the time frame of the bombing. And eventually, Joe McAndrew (Don Baker), a known I.R.A. member, admits to the bombing. Dubbed the Maguire Seven, seven others, primarily members of Gerry's extended family including his father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite), are accused of being accessories to the bombing. Following on the work initiated by Giuseppe, Gerry works on a campaign to prove their collective innocence, this work with the assistance of compassionate lawyer Gareth Peirce (Dame Emma Thompson). As Gareth works on this campaign, she is faced with obstacle after obstacle placed by Robert Dixon (Corin Redgrave), who led the initial investigation and questioning of the four accused on behalf of the Police.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/065-In-the-Name-of-the-Father" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/1uPyzk3iotWUIyLo31j1LP" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU3YWYwNTQtZTdiMC00NjY5LTlmMTMtZDFlYTEyODBjMTk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_SY300_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">b13</span><br><span class="title">Tenet</span><br><span class="date">2020</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 7.3 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6723592"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>In a twilight world of international espionage, an unnamed CIA operative, known as The Protagonist, is recruited by a mysterious organization called Tenet to participate in a global assignment that unfolds beyond real time.

As such, Shukishi and Tomi make the unilateral decision to have an extended visit in Tokyo with their children, pediatrician Koichi Hirayama and beautician Shige Kaneko, and their respective families (which includes two grandchildren). In transit, they make an unexpected stop in Osaka and stay with their other son, Keiso Hirayama. All of their children treat the visit more as an obligation than a want, each trying to figure out what to do with their parents while they continue on with their own daily lives. At one point, they even decide to ship their parents off to an inexpensive resort at Atami Hot Springs rather than spend time with them. The only offspring who makes a concerted effort on this trip is Noriko Hirayama, their widowed daughter-in-law, whose husband, Shoji Hirayama, was killed eight years earlier in the war. Following the vacation, each child comes to some conclusion of their general behavior toward their parents, not only on this trip but throughout their entire adult lives.

Jerry is upset at the bloodshed, which turns loose a pregnant sheriff from Brainerd, MN who is tenacious in attempting to solve the three murders in her jurisdiction.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/077-Fargo" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/1msGJqQH4Ee5i9YfdLVSdB" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWZhMjhhZmYtOTIzOC00MGYzLWI1OGYtM2ZkN2IxNTI4ZWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDAzNDk0MTQ@._V1_SY300_CR1,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">173</span><br><span class="title">Andhadhun</span><br><span class="date">2018</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.2 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8108198"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>Akash a blind pianist is preparing for a London concert.Sophie's scooter bumps into Akash and upon finding he a pianist she takes him to her restaurant Franco's run by her father and offers him a job.Akash meets 70s actor Pramod Sinha at the restaurant who asks him to do a private concert of his songs at his residence to surprise his wife Simi.

He is traveling from his home in Stockholm to Lund to accept an honorary degree. Instead of flying as was the original plan, he decides to take the day long drive instead. Along for the ride is his daughter-in-law Marianne, who had been staying with him for the month but has now decided to go home. The many stops and encounters along the way make him reminisce about various parts of his life. Those stops which make him reminisce directly are at his childhood summer home, at the home of his equally emotionally cold mother, and at a gas station where the attendants praise him as a man for his work. But the lives of other people they encounter almost mirror his own, including hitchhikers Sara, Viktor and Anders - who remind him of his cousin Sara who he was going to marry, himself and his irresponsible brother Sigfrid who Sara eventually married - a bickering married couple Sten and Berit Alman, and Marianne and her husband and Isak's son Evald, whose marriage is as strained as was his own.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/079-Wild-Strawberries" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/0sr5CMtSyXyQ2wwGZwIaPg" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjMxYzBiNjUtZDliNC00MDAyLTg3N2QtOWNjNmNhZGQzNDg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjE2MjQwNjc@._V1_SY300_CR1,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">171</span><br><span class="title">Finding Nemo</span><br><span class="date">2003</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.2 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266543"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>A clown fish named Marlin lives in the Great Barrier Reef and loses his son, Nemo, after he ventures into the open sea, despite his father's constant warnings about many of the ocean's dangers.

When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called &quot;blade runners&quot;, have the job of destroying - or in their parlance &quot;retiring&quot; - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It's now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty. One, Leon Kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon's trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell's fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael, who works as Tyrell's assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human. The problem is not only Rachael's assistance to Deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/084-Blade-Runner" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/2q8pQIPwXNPsmnmkEOjzIS" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY5NmNlMmQtYzRlYy00NGQ5LWFkYjYtNzExZmQyMTg0ZDA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDIzMzcwNjc@._V1_SX202_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">166</span><br><span class="title">The Bridge on the River Kwai</span><br><span class="date">1958</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.2 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050212"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>During WW II, allied POWs in a Japanese internment camp are ordered to build a bridge to accommodate the Burma-Siam railway.

In actuality, the creature on display is indeed a man, twenty-one-year-old Joseph &quot;John&quot; Merrick, who has several physical deformities, including an oversized and disfigured skull, and an oversized and disfigured right shoulder. Brutish Bytes, his &quot;owner&quot;, only wants whatever he can get economically by presenting Merrick as a freak. Treves manages to bring Merrick under his care at the hospital, not without several of its own obstacles, including being questioned by those in authority since Merrick cannot be cured. Treves initially believes Bytes' assertion that mute Merrick is an imbecile, but ultimately learns that Merrick can speak and is a well-read and articulate man. As news of Merrick hits the London newspapers, he becomes a celebrated curiosity amongst London's upper class, including with Mrs. Kendal, a famed actress. Despite treated much more humanely, the question becomes whether Treves' actions are a further exploitation of Merrick. And as Merrick becomes more famous, others try to get their two-cents worth from who still remains a curiosity and a freak to most, including to Bytes, who has since lost his meal ticket.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/092-The-Elephant-Man" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/3zkMxYzwm8c68BkGTOORom" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA5Zjc3ZTMtMmU5YS00YTMwLWI4MWUtYTU0YTVmNjVmODZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SY300_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">158</span><br><span class="title">Trainspotting</span><br><span class="date">1996</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.1 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>A wild, freeform, Rabelaisian trip through the darkest recesses of Edinburgh low-life, focusing on Mark Renton and his attempt to give up his heroin habit, and how the latter affects his relationship with family and friends: Sean Connery wannabe Sick Boy, dimbulb Spud, psycho Begbie, 14-year-old girlfriend Diane, and clean-cut athlete Tommy, who's never touched drugs but can't help being curious about them...</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/093-Trainspotting" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/3YMjj9UnZuSDGiI9jUk3pN" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5Njk3MjM4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTc5MTE1MQ@@._V1_SY300_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">157</span><br><span class="title">No Country for Old Men</span><br><span class="date">2007</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.2 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>In rural Texas, welder and hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the remains of several drug runners who have all killed each other in an exchange gone violently wrong.

His business partner is his son H.W., who in reality he &quot;acquired&quot; when H.W.'s biological single father, who worked on one of Daniel's rigs, got killed in a workplace accident. Daniel is deeply protective of H.W. if only for what H.W. brings to the partnership. Eli Sunday is one in a pair of twins, whose family farm Daniel purchases for the major oil deposit located on it. Eli, the local preacher and a self-proclaimed faith healer, wants the money from the sale of the property to finance his own church. The lives of the two competitive men often clash as Daniel pumps oil off the property and tries to acquire all the surrounding land at bargain prices to be able to build a pipeline to the coast, and as Eli tries to build his own religious empire.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/100-There-Will-Be-Blood" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fy6Eil0ecpI0RZUdNDHHD" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTdiOTIyZTQtNmQ1OS00NjZlLWIyMTgtYzk5Y2M3ZDVmMDk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAzMDg4NzU0._V1_SY300_CR1,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">b20</span><br><span class="title">Everything Everywhere All at Once</span><br><span class="date">2022</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 7.9 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6710474"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>With her laundromat teetering on the brink of failure and her marriage to wimpy husband Waymond on the rocks, overworked Evelyn Wang struggles to cope with everything, including tattered relationships with her judgmental father Gong Gong and her daughter Joy.

Gittes specializes in cheating-spouse cases. His current target is Hollis Mulwray, high-profile chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, whose wife suspects him of infidelity. In following Mulwray, Gittes witnesses some usual business dealings, such as a public meeting for construction of a new dam to create additional water supply for Los Angeles, as fresh water is vital to the growing community during the chronic drought; Mulwray opposes the dam. Eventually Gittes sees Mulwray meeting with an unknown young woman who isn't his wife. Once news of the supposed tryst between Mulwray and this woman hits the media, additional information comes to light that makes Gittes believe that Mulwray is being framed for something and that he himself is being set up. In his investigation of the issue behind Mulwray's framing and his own setup, Gittes is assisted by Mulwray's wife Evelyn, but he thinks she isn't being forthright with him. The further he gets into the investigation, the more secrets he uncovers about the Mulwrays' professional and personal dealings, including Mulwray's former business-partnership with Evelyn's father, Noah Cross. The identity of the unknown woman may be the key to uncovering the whole story.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/102-Chinatown" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YXJkzMwmy2Z9Z7YZOQkSf" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAzMzEwYzctNjc1MC00Nzg5LWFmMGItMTgzYmMyNTY2OTQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SY300_CR1,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">148</span><br><span class="title">My Father and My Son</span><br><span class="date">2005</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.2 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476735"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>Sadik is one of the rebellious youth who has been politically active as a university student and became a left-wing journalist in the 70's, despite his father's expectations of him becoming an agricultural engineer and taking control of their family farm in an Aegean village.

That case is the brutal rape and murder of Liliana Coloto. In addition to seeing the extreme grief of the victim's husband Ricardo Morales, Benjamín, his assistant Pablo Sandoval, and newly hired department chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings were personally affected by the case as Benjamín and Pablo tracked the killer, hence the reason why the unsatisfactory ending to the case has always bothered him. Despite the department already having two other suspects, Benjamín and Pablo ultimately were certain that a man named Isidoro Gómez is the real killer. Although he is aware that historical accuracy is not paramount for the novel, the process of revisiting the case is more an issue of closure for him. He tries to speak to the key players in the case, most specifically Irene, who still works in the justice department and who he has always been attracted to but never pursued due to the differences in their ages and social classes. The other issue is that Gómez is still at large, no one aware if he is alive or dead. But as Pablo at the time mentioned that passion is one thing that cannot be changed in behavior, Benjamín learns now that that premise still holds true.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/109-The-Secret-in-Their-Eyes" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/7MdNiWVWWRJpxubZeBTI8C" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjRmODkzNDItMTNhNi00YjJlLTg0ZjAtODlhZTM0YzgzYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQ1ODk3MTQ@._V1_SY300_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">141</span><br><span class="title">Raging Bull</span><br><span class="date">1981</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.2 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081398"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>When Jake LaMotta steps into a boxing ring and obliterates his opponent, he's a prizefighter.

The most promising offer turns out to be the driver for African-American classical pianist Don Shirley for a concert tour into the Deep South states. Although hardly enthused at working for a Black man, Tony accepts the job and they begin their trek armed with &quot;The Negro Motorist Green Book,&quot; a guide for safe travel through America's racial segregation.

The priest and the woodcutter are recounting the story of a murdered samurai whose body the woodcutter discovered three days earlier in a forest grove. Both were summoned to testify at the murder trial, the priest who ran into the samurai and his wife traveling through the forest just before the murder occurred. Three other people who testified at the trial are supposedly the only direct witnesses: a notorious bandit named Taj�maru, who allegedly murdered the samurai and raped his wife; the white veil cloaked wife of the samurai; and the samurai himself who testifies through the use of a medium. The three tell a similarly structured story - that Taj�maru kidnapped and bound the samurai so that he could rape the wife - but which ultimately contradict each other, the motivations and the actual killing being what differ. The woodcutter reveals at Rash�mon that he knows more than he let on at the trial, thus bringing into question his own actions. But another discovery at Rash�mon and the resulting actions from the discovery bring back into focus the woodcutter's own humanity or lack thereof.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/129-Rashomon" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span> </a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/https://open.spotify.com/episode/5maHA3x1FKkFbSCXs5kLT8" class="poster-button listen-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/spotify.svg"> <span>Listen</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZjNTJlZGUtZTE1Ny00ZDc4LTgwYjUtMzk0NDgwYzZjYTk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SY300_CR1,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">121</span><br><span class="title">Heat</span><br><span class="date">1996</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.3 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>Hunters and their prey--Neil and his professional criminal crew hunt to score big money targets (banks, vaults, armored cars) and are, in turn, hunted by Lt.

To distinguish himself from all the other lowly cogs in the company in the hopes of moving up the corporate ladder, he often works late, but only because he can't get into his apartment, located off of Central Park West, since he has provided it to a handful of company executives - Mssrs.

The first is wealthy and elegant platinum blonde Madeleine Elster, the wife of his college acquaintance Gavin Elster, who hires John to follow her in Gavin's belief that she may be a danger to herself in thinking that she has recently been possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes, Madeleine's great-grandmother who she knows nothing about, but who Gavin knows committed suicide in being mentally unbalanced when she was twenty-six, Madeleine's current age. The second is Judy Barton, who John spots on the street one day. Judy is a working class girl, but what makes John obsessed with her is that, despite her working class style and her brunette hair, she is the spitting image of Madeleine, into who he tries to transform Judy. The initial question that John has is if there is some connection between Madeleine and Judy. What happens between John and individually with Madeleine and Judy is affected by the reason John took that early retirement: a recent workplace incident that showed that he is acrophobic which leads to a severe case of vertigo whenever he looks down from tall heights.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/161-Vertigo" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTdiNzJlOWUtNWMwNS00NmFlLWI0YTEtZmI3YjIzZWUyY2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX202_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">89</span><br><span class="title">Requiem for a Dream</span><br><span class="date">2001</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.3 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180093"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a retired widow, living in a small apartment.

Unknown even to himself, a blind beggar, who sold the murderer a balloon for one of the child victims, may have key information as to the murderer's identity. The murder squad's work is made even more difficult with the large number of tips they receive from the paranoid public, who are quick to accuse anyone of suspicious activity solely for their own piece of mind that someone - anyone - is apprehended for the heinous crimes. Conversely, many want to take the case into their own hands, including the town's leading criminals since the increased police presence has placed a strain on their ability to conduct criminal activity. Although they both have the same end goal of capturing the murderer, the police and the criminals seem to be working at cross purposes, which may provide an edge to the murderer in getting away.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/164-M" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI0MzcxMTYtZDVkMy00NjY1LTgyMTYtZmUxN2M3NmQ2NWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX202_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">86</span><br><span class="title">Good Will Hunting</span><br><span class="date">1998</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.3 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>A touching tale of a wayward young man who struggles to find his identity, living in a world where he can solve any problem, except the one brewing deep within himself, until one day he meets his soul mate who opens his mind and his heart.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/165-Good-Will-Hunting" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTJiNDEzOWYtMTVjOC00ZjlmLWE0NGMtZmE1OWVmZDQ2OWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_SY300_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">85</span><br><span class="title">Inglourious Basterds</span><br><span class="date">2009</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.3 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>In German-occupied France, young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa.

When the remaining people assemble at the premeditated rendezvous point (a warehouse), they begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover cop.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/167-Reservoir-Dogs" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJlNzUzNGMtYTAwMS00ZjI2LWFmNWQtODcxNWUxODA5YmU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_SX202_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">83</span><br><span class="title">Amadeus</span><br><span class="date">1985</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.4 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>Antonio Salieri believes that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's music is divine and miraculous. He wishes he was himself as good a musician as Mozart so that he can praise the Lord through composing. He began his career as a devout man who believes his success and talent as a composer are God's rewards for his piety. He's also content as the respected, financially well-off, court composer of Austrian Emperor Joseph II. But he's shocked to learn that Mozart is such a vulgar creature, and can't understand why God favored Mozart to be his instrument. Salieri's envy has made him an enemy of God whose greatness was evident in Mozart. He is ready to take revenge against God and Mozart for his own musical mediocrity.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/168-Amadeus" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDU2ZWJlMjktMTRhMy00ZTA5LWEzNDgtYmNmZTEwZTViZWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQ2OTk4MzI@._V1_SX202_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">82</span><br><span class="title">Toy Story</span><br><span class="date">1995</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.3 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>A little boy named Andy loves to be in his room, playing with his toys, especially his doll named &quot;Woody&quot;.

He is a husband to real estate agent Carolyn Burnham and father to high school student Jane Burnham. Although Lester and Carolyn once loved each other, they now merely tolerate each other. Typical wallflower Jane also hates both her parents; the three suffer individually in silence in their home life. Jane tries to steer clear of both her parents. Carolyn, relatively new to the real estate business, wants to create the persona of success to further her career, aspiring to the professional life of Buddy Kane, the king of the real estate business in their neighborhood. Lester merely walks mindlessly through life, including at his job in advertising. His company is downsizing, and he, like all the other employees, has to justify his position to the newly hired efficiency expert to keep his job. Things change for Lester when he falls in love at first sight with Jane's more experienced classmate, Angela Hayes. Both Janie and Angela can see Lester's sexual infatuation with Angela, who courts such attention from any man as a sign that she is model material, she having once appeared in Seventeen and is a career to which she aspires. Lester's infatuation with Angela gives him a reenergized view on life, where he openly doesn't care anymore what anyone thinks about what he does, anyone except Angela. This infatuation coincides with the Fittses moving in next door: homophobic disciplinarian US Marine Colonel Frank Fitts who rules the house with a military fist (that fist being both figurative and literal), his semi-comatose wife Barbara Fitts, and their bright and quietly subversive 18-year-old son Ricky Fitts, who openly abides by his father's rules while behind the scenes lives by his own quite different perspective. Much like Lester's infatuation, Ricky immediately becomes infatuated with Jane; he considers girls like Angela as ordinary. The entry of Angela and the Fittses into the Burnhams' lives ultimately leads to each of the players confronting what is truly in his or her heart.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/176-American-Beauty" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODRmZDVmNzUtZDA4ZC00NjhkLWI2M2UtN2M0ZDIzNDcxYThjL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk0MzMzODA@._V1_SY300_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">74</span><br><span class="title">Your Name.</span><br><span class="date">2016</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.4 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5311514"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>Mitsuha is the daughter of the mayor of a small mountain town.

Meanwhile at the Pentagon War Room, key persons including Muffley, Turgidson and nuclear scientist and adviser, a former Nazi named Dr. Strangelove, are discussing measures to stop the attack or mitigate its blow-up into an all out nuclear war with the Soviets. Against Turgidson's wishes, Muffley brings Soviet Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky into the War Room, and get his boss, Soviet Premier Dimitri Kisov, on the hot line to inform him of what's going on. The Americans in the War Room are dismayed to learn that the Soviets have an as yet unannounced Doomsday Device to detonate if any of their key targets are hit. As Ripper, Mandrake and those in the War Room try and work the situation to their end goal, Major T.J. &quot;King&quot; Kong, one of the B-52 bomber pilots, is working on his own agenda of deploying his bomb where ever he can on enemy soil if he can't make it to his intended target.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/183-Dr.-Strangelove-or_-How-I-Learned-to-Stop-Worrying-and-Love-the-Bomb" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTZkYmI0MmEtNGFlZC00OWZjLWFjMmItMjk1OWZkOWJiZGVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX202_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">67</span><br><span class="title">Princess Mononoke</span><br><span class="date">2001</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.3 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119698"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>While protecting his village from rampaging boar-god/demon, a confident young warrior, Ashitaka, is stricken by a deadly curse.

Mesmerized with trinkets of Earth's history and show tunes, WALL-E is alone on Earth except for a sprightly pet cockroach. One day, EVE, a sleek (and dangerous) reconnaissance robot, is sent to Earth to find proof that life is once again sustainable. WALL-E falls in love with EVE. WALL-E rescues EVE from a dust storm and shows her a living plant he found amongst the rubble. Consistent with her &quot;directive&quot;, EVE takes the plant and automatically enters a deactivated state except for a blinking green beacon. WALL-E, doesn't understand what has happened to his new friend, but, true to his love, he protects her from wind, rain, and lightning, even as she is unresponsive. One day a massive ship comes to reclaim EVE, but WALL-E, out of love or loneliness, hitches a ride on the outside of the ship to rescue EVE. The ship arrives back at a large space cruise ship, which is carrying all of the humans who evacuated Earth 700 years earlier. The people of Earth ride around this space resort on hovering chairs which give them a constant feed of TV and video chatting. They drink all of their meals through a straw out of laziness and/or bone loss, and are all so fat that they can barely move. When the auto-pilot computer, acting on hastily-given instructions sent many centuries before, tries to prevent the people of Earth from returning by stealing the plant, WALL-E, EVE, the portly captain, and a band of broken robots stage a mutiny.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/186-WALL·E" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNDkxMTgzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTkwNTQ3NjM@._V1_SY300_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">64</span><br><span class="title">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</span><br><span class="date">2018</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.4 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the creative minds behind The Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street, bring their unique talents to a fresh vision of a different Spider-Man Universe, with a groundbreaking visual style that's the first of its kind. &quot;Spider-Man(TM): Into the Spider-Verse&quot; introduces Brooklyn teen Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), and the limitless possibilities of the Spider-Verse, where more than one can wear the mask.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/187-Spider-Man_-Into-the-Spider-Verse" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI5Nzc0OTMtYzBkMS00NjkxLThmM2UtNjM2ODgxN2M5NjNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_SX202_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">63</span><br><span class="title">Paths of Glory</span><br><span class="date">1958</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.4 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050825"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>The futility and irony of the war in the trenches in WWI is shown as a unit commander in the French army must deal with the mutiny of his men and a glory-seeking general after part of his force falls back under fire in an impossible attack.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/188-Paths-of-Glory" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFlYmY2MGEtZjVkYS00YzU4LTg0YjQtYzY1ZGE3NTA5NGQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX202_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">62</span><br><span class="title">The Shining</span><br><span class="date">1980</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.4 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>Haunted by a persistent writer's block, the aspiring author and recovering alcoholic, Jack Torrance, drags his wife, Wendy, and his gifted son, Danny, up snow-capped Colorado's secluded Overlook Hotel after taking up a job as an off-season caretaker.

He believes in a pure Aryan state and the decimation of the Jews. This situation is unknown to a simple Jewish Tomainian barber who has been hospitalized since a WWI battle. Upon his release the barber, who had been suffering from memory loss about the war, is shown the new persecuted life of the Jews by many living in the Jewish ghetto, including a washerwoman named Hannah with whom he begins a relationship. The barber is ultimately spared such persecution by Commander Schultz, whom he saved in that WWI battle. The lives of all Jews in Tomainia are eventually spared with a policy shift by Hynkel himself, who is doing so for ulterior motives. But those motives include a desire for world domination, starting with the invasion of neighboring Osterlich, which may be threatened by Benzino Napaloni, the dictator of neighboring Bacteria. Ultimately Schultz, who has turned traitor against Hynkel's regime, and the barber may be able to join forces to take control of the situation, using Schultz's inside knowledge of the regime's workings and the barber's uncanny resemblance to one of those in power.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/194-The-Great-Dictator" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTcyNjk1MjgtOWI3Mi00YzQwLWI5MTktMzY4ZmI2NDAyNzYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SY300_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">56</span><br><span class="title">Memento</span><br><span class="date">2001</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.4 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>Memento chronicles two separate stories of Leonard, an ex-insurance investigator who can no longer build new memories, as he attempts to find the murderer of his wife, which is the last thing he remembers.

When one of the eggs is disturbed, the crew realizes that they are not alone on the spaceship and they must deal with the consequences.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/198-Alien" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2FhYjEyYmYtMDI1Yy00YTdlLWI2NWQtYmEzNzAxOGY1NjY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA3NTIyNDg@._V1_SY300_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">52</span><br><span class="title">Cinema Paradiso</span><br><span class="date">1989</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.5 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095765"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>A boy who grew up in a native Sicilian Village returns home as a famous director after receiving news about the death of an old friend. Told in a flashback, Salvatore reminiscences about his childhood and his relationship with Alfredo, a projectionist at Cinema Paradiso. Under the fatherly influence of Alfredo, Salvatore fell in love with film making, with the duo spending many hours discussing about films and Alfredo painstakingly teaching Salvatore the skills that became a stepping stone for the young boy into the world of film making. The film brings the audience through the changes in cinema and the dying trade of traditional film making, editing and screening.

This goal is despite not coming from a pedigree of greatest, musical or otherwise, with Jim, his high-school-teacher father, being a failed writer. Andrew is starting his first year at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, the best music school in the United States. At Shaffer, being the best means being accepted to study under Terence Fletcher and being asked to play in his studio band, which represents the school at jazz competitions. Based on their less than positive first meeting, Andrew is surprised that Fletcher asks him to join the band, albeit in the alternate drummer position which he is more than happy to do initially. Andrew quickly learns that Fletcher operates on fear and intimidation, never settling for what he considers less than the best each and every time. Being the best in Fletcher's mind does not only entail playing well, but knowing that you're playing well and if not what you're doing wrong. His modus operandi creates an atmosphere of fear and of every man or woman for him/herself within the band. Regardless, Andrew works hard to be the best. He has to figure out his life priorities and what he is willing to sacrifice to be the best. The other question becomes how much emotional abuse he will endure by Fletcher to reach that greatness, which he may believe he can only achieve with the avenues opened up by Fletcher.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/205-Whiplash" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MTY2OTIxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjQ4NjY3._V1_SY300_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">45</span><br><span class="title">The Departed</span><br><span class="date">2006</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.5 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>In this crime-action tour de force, the South Boston state police force is waging war on Irish-American organized crime.

An honorable end to such fate under the samurai code is ritual suicide, or hara-kiri (self-inflicted disembowelment). An elder warrior, Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act. There, he learns of the fate of his son-in-law, a young samurai who sought work at the house but was instead barbarically forced to commit traditional hara-kiri in an excruciating manner with a dull bamboo blade. In flashbacks the samurai tells the tragic story of his son-in-law, and how he was forced to sell his real sword to support his sick wife and child.

Without even knowing it, they, especially Mr. and Mrs. Kim, literally smell of poverty. Often as a collective, they perpetrate minor scams to get by, and even when they have jobs, they do the minimum work required. Ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. Despite not having that university education, Ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend Min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to Park Da-hye, who Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is in university. The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect Namgoong. While Mr. and Mrs. Park are all about status, Mrs. Park has a flighty, simpleminded mentality and temperament, which Min tells Ki-woo to feel comfortable in lying to her about his education to get the job. In getting the job, Ki-woo further learns that Mrs. Park is looking for an art therapist for the Parks' adolescent son, Da-song, Ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend &quot;Jessica&quot;, really Ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four Kims. In Ki-woo also falling for Da-hye, he begins to envision himself in that house, and thus the Kims as a collective start a plan for all the Kims, like Ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants in the Parks' employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired. The most difficult to get rid of may be Moon-gwang, the Parks' housekeeper who literally came with the house - she Namgoong's housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the Parks themselves. The question then becomes how far the Kims can take this scam in their quest to become their version of the Parks.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/222-Parasite" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjlmZmI5MDctNDE2YS00YWE0LWE5ZWItZDBhYWQ0NTcxNWRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SY300_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">28</span><br><span class="title">Spirited Away</span><br><span class="date">2002</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 8.6 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>Chihiro and her parents are moving to a small Japanese town in the countryside, much to Chihiro's dismay.

They go through the tunnel and find an abandoned amusement park on the other side, with its own little town. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff, they decide to eat and pay later. However, Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to explore the theme park a bit more. She meets a boy named Haku who tells her that Chihiro and her parents are in danger, and they must leave immediately. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. In addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods. At the center of the town is a bathhouse where these creatures go to relax. The owner of the bathhouse is the evil witch Yubaba, who is intent on keeping all trespassers as captive workers, including Chihiro.

After graduation, she aspires to work in the agency's Behavioral Science Unit under the leadership of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). While she is still a trainee, Crawford asks her to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a psychiatrist imprisoned, thus far, for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; (Ted Levine), who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern U.S., all young women, who are slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her, as a woman, to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, with her often having to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along, as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more dire turn when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine.

Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.</p></span></div><div class="buttons"><a href="/episode/249-The-Godfather" class="poster-button more-button"><img class="inline-svg" src="/img/info.svg"> <span>More</span></a></div></div></div><div class="poster"><img class="poster-image" style="filter: grayscale(85%); opacity: 0.5;" onload="this.style.opacity=1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE3ODcxYzMtY2YzZC00NmNlLWJiNDMtZDViZWM2MzIxZDYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjAwNDUxODI@._V1_SX202_CR0,0,202,300_.jpg"><div class="poster-contents"><div class="poster-text"><span class="index-no">1</span><br><span class="title">The Shawshank Redemption</span><br><span class="date">1995</span><span class="imdb-score"> <img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="18px" src="/img/star.svg"> 9.3 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161"><img class="inline-svg" height="18px" width="26px" src="/img/imdb.svg"> </a></span><span class="description"><p>Chronicles the experiences of a formerly successful banker as a prisoner in the gloomy jailhouse of Shawshank after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit.
